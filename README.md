# SynDataGeneration 

This code is used to generate synthetic scenes for the task of instance/object detection. Given images of objects in isolation from multiple views and some background scenes, it generates full scenes with multiple objects and annotations files which can be used to train an object detector. The approach used for generation works welll with region based object detection methods like [Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn).

## Pre-requisites 
1. OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
2. PIL (pip install Pillow)
3. Poisson Blending (Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/yskmt/pb)
4. PyBlur (pip install pyblur)
